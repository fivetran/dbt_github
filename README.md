# Github dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_github/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?

- Produces modeled tables that leverage Github data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/github) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/github#schemainformation) and builds off of the output from our [github source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source).

- Provides insight into GitHub issues and pull requests by enhancing these core objects with commonly used metrics. 
- Produces metrics tables, which increase understanding of your team's velocity over time. Metrics are available on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly level.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled github data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_github/).

<!--section="github_transformation_model-->
The following table provides a detailed list of all models materialized within this package by default. 
> TIP: See more details about these models in the package's [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_github/#!/overview?g_v=1&g_e=seeds).

| **Model**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                               |

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:

- At least one Fivetran Github connector syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

## Step 2: Install the package
Include the following github package version in your `packages.yml` file.
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/github
    version: [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```

Do NOT include the `github_source` package in this file. The transformation package itself has a dependency on it and will install the source package as well.


## Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your [destination](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile) and the `github` schema. If this is not where your Github data is (for example, if your github schema is named `github_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
  github_source:
    github_database: your_database_name
    github_schema: your_schema_name 
```

## Step 4: Disable models for non-existent sources
Your Github connector might not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in Github or have actively excluded some tables from your syncs.

If you do not have the `REPO_TEAM` table synced, add the following variable to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    github__using_repo_team: false # by default this is assumed to be true
```

*Note: This package only integrates the above variable. If you'd like to disable other models, please create an [issue](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github/issues) specifying which ones.*

## (Optional) Step 5: Additional configurations

<details open><summary>Expand/collapse configurations</summary>

### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the Github staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_github_source`) and your Github modeling models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_github`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your Github data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    github_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
    github:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    github_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
</details>

## (Optional) Step 6: Orchestrate your models with Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™    
<details><summary>Expand for more details</summary>

Fivetran offers the ability for you to orchestrate your dbt project through [Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt). Learn how to set up your project for orchestration through Fivetran in our [Transformations for dbt Core setup guides](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt#setupguide).
